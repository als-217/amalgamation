A rating system for NBA teams created by combining several models.
There are countless models for predicting basketball games and rating the teams that play in those games. Many focus on rating teams as a sum of their parts, or rather a sum of their statistics. Others look at individual players and try to generalize their performances to an entire season. Suprisingly few of the papers I read brought both ends of the spectrum together. So, I became curious as to what could be done when these two types of models were combined,
I started by reading papers in journals and in Medium articles to search for the models that I believed would be the best candidates to combine together. After a few days of reading and taking notes I decided on three models.
The first used dynamic bayesian networks to model in-game probabilities of winning. The second summed in-game win probabilities from an entire season as a rating system for teams. The final model is from 538, and is their RAPTOR player metric model that analyzes players' contributions on offense and defense.
